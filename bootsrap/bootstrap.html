            <h1>User Insight</h1>
            <p>During this interview we discovered many online- shoppers struggle with long shipment from small
                businesses or unable to make an order to another state or country. Therefore, we believe that creating a
                reliable shopping app where customers can view verified information about small businesses, their
                products, and reviews will open up opportunities for small businesses to gain trust from customers, and
                thus, improve customer experience. We might do this by providing platform that unite all small
                businesses which gives them an excellent feature e.g.: fast free shipping not only locally but also
                international distances as well. It will help grow local business into international. Also, our users
                will be able to see transparently contribution and they will allow to do donations to their favorite
                brands.</p>

        <h1>Problem Statement</h1>
        <p>Online shoppers who want to support small businesses need a reliable platform that is built on trust and
            transparency because shoppers often have to spend a lot of time combing through reviews to verify the
            genuineness of the product and don't know how much of their money is actually going back to the seller.
            How might we provide a space for shoppers to shop stress-free while feeling confident that they are making a
            contribution to the small businesses they buy from.</p>

                <p>JED, a platform that focuses on building trust between the seller and customers. Customers have
                    access to detailed information on the product and a cost down of each item they purchased.
                    Information about the sellers are easy to find and customers can also support them by donations.
